# Error Correction Codes

This notebook presents an implementation of different Error Correction Codes in Python.

A message class is provided which allows to convert from strings and ints to bits and back using the desired encoding scheme. This class allows to alter sequences of bits to simulate a message that has been received with noise and hence it is wrongly interpreted by the receiver.

For Hamming error correction examples preview the [hamming.ipynb](hamming.ipynb) notebook.

For Reed-Solomon error correction examples preview the [reed_solomon.ipynb](reed_solomon.ipynb) notebook.
