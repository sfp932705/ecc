# Error Correction Codes

This notebook presents an implementation of different Error Correction Codes in Python.

A message class is provided which allows to convert from strings to bits and back using the desired encoding scheme. This class allows to alter sequences of bits to simulate a message that has been received with noise and hence it is wrongly interpreted by the receiver.

For Hamming error correction examples preview the [hamming.ipynb](hamming.ipynb) notebook.
